# wifi-card
Create a business card (image) containing a QR code, SSID and password.

Usage: See `python -m wifi_card --help`

Currently, only "simple" passwords and SSIDs are supported.
If any of those contains special characters, they must be encoded manually.u

No encoding happens in this tool. This may change at some time.
